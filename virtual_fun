VIRTUAL FUNCTION:
                .Virtual function is a member function which is declared within base class only and redined by derived class.
                .virtual function should written in base class only.
                .with the help of base class pointer,we can access both base class and derived class members.
                .when using virtual function we can create seperated object for base class and derived class.




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class base
{
    public:
    int x=5;
     virtual void display()
    {
        cout<<"Base class X value :"<<x<<endl;
    }
};
class Derived:public base
{
    public:
    int y=8;
    void display()
    {
        cout<<"Derived class Y value :"<<y<<endl;
    }
};
int main() {
 base *bptr,b;
bptr=&b;
 bptr->display();
Derived d;
bptr=&d;
bptr->display();
    return 0;
}
